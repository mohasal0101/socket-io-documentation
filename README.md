-   [OSI Model](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/osi-model-networking-layers-explained-in-plain-english/)
-   [Socket.io Documentation](https://socket.io/docs/v4/)
-   [Socket.io Server API](https://socket.io/docs/v4/server-api)
-   [Socket.io Client API](https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-api)

- The OSI model is a conceptual framework that is used to describe how a network functions. In plain English, the OSI model helped standardize the way computer systems send information to each other.
- Socket.IO is an event-driven library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers
- The socket API is  **a collection of socket calls that enable you to perform the following primary communication functions between application programs**: Set up and establish connections to other users on the network. Send and receive data to and from other users.
- **socket-io.**  **client is the code for the client-side implementation of socket.io**. That code may be used either by a browser client or by a server process that is initiating a socket.io connection to some other server (thus playing the client-side role in a socket.io connection).
